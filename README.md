# React + Vite
Anecdotes Step 1

The world of software engineering is filled with anecdotes that distill timeless truths from our field into short one-liners. Expand the following application by adding a button that can be clicked to display a random anecdote from the field of software engineering:

import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  const anecdotes = [
    'If it hurts, do it more often.',
    'Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later!',
    'The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time...The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.',
    'Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.',
    'Premature optimization is the root of all evil.',
    'Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.',
    'Programming without an extremely heavy use of console.log is same as if a doctor would refuse to use x-rays or blood tests when diagnosing patients.',
    'The only way to go fast, is to go well.'
  ]
   
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      {anecdotes[selected]}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App

Content if the file main.jsx is the same as in previoues exercises.

Find out hiow togenerate random numbers in JavaScript , e.g. via search engine or on Mozilla Developer Network. Remember you can test generating random numbers e.g. straight in the console of your browser.

Your finished application could look something like this:

# Usar hooks mais eficientes em react

Expanding on the anecdote application and integrating more advanced React hooks like `useReducer`and `useMemo`can enhance your understanding and provide a more robust approach to state management and optimizaion. Here's how you can refactor the application using these hooks:

## using `useReducer`

The `useReducer`hookn is typically preferred over ` useState` when you have more complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. It's also handy when mananging in deeply nested components.

#### Refactoring with `useReducer`

##### 1. ** Define the reducer function: ** This function will handle the state transitions based on dispatched actions.

#### 2 Setup the useReducer hook

replace the useState for managing votes and selected anecdote.

### Using `useMemo`

The `useMemo`hook is usefol for memoizing expensive calculations. If determining the anecdote with most votes become computationally expensive (especially as list grows), `useMemo`can optimize this by recalcuting only when the votes array changes.

### Updated App Component with `useReducer`and `useMemo`

```
import { useReducer, useMemo } from 'react';

const anecdotes = [
  'If it hurts, do it more often.',
  'Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later!',
  // Add all other anecdotes here...
];

const initialState = {
  selected: 0,
  votes: new Array(anecdotes.length).fill(0)
};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'VOTE':
      const newVotes = [...state.votes];
      newVotes[state.selected] += 1;
      return { ...state, votes: newVotes };
    case 'NEXT_ANECDOTE':
      return { ...state, selected: Math.floor(Math.random() * anecdotes.length) };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const App = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const maxVotesIndex = useMemo(() => {
    const max = Math.max(...state.votes);
    return state.votes.indexOf(max);
  }, [state.votes]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Anecdote of the day</h1>
      <div>
        {anecdotes[state.selected]}
        <br />
        has {state.votes[state.selected]} votes
      </div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'VOTE' })}>Vote</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'NEXT_ANECDOTE' })}>Next anecdote</button>
  
      <h1>Anecdote with most votes</h1>
      {state.votes[maxVotesIndex] > 0 ? (
        <div>
          {anecdotes[maxVotesIndex]}
          <br />
          has {state.votes[maxVotesIndex]} votes
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>No votes yet.</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

## Key concepts and Changes

### . Reducer function

handles actions like voting and changing anecdotes. It takes the current state and an action, then returns the new state.

. useReducer Hook: Manages complex state logic more predictably.

. Ã¹seMemo Hook`: Optimizes performance by memoizing the calculation of the anecdote with the most votes, preventing unnecessary recalculations.

This approach uses `useReducer`for state management , wich, makes the state transuitions predictable and centralized, and `useMemo`ensures that the application is eficient, recaulculating the mos voted anecdote only whem necessary. These hooks provide robust tools for building complex and performant React applications.
